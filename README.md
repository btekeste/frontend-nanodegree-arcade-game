## Instructions
The Classic Arcade Game is a project inspired by the popular '80s arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger). The player is in a mission to dodge all the enemies on the way to reach the top waters as in this sample [video](https://youtu.be/kaifTslArtY). Use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate through the path.
